Description:

SoilStrength Analyzer is a desktop application built using PyQt5 in Python. It provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing soil and subbase strength based on various test parameters. The application is designed to calculate and generate reports for soil density, moisture content, compaction ratio, and subbase density.

Features:

1. Tab-Based Interface:The application features a tab-based interface, allowing users to switch between soil and subbase analysis effortlessly.

2. Soil Analysis: Users can input data such as soil weight, moisture container weight, moisture before weight, and moisture after weight. The application calculates field density, wet weight, dry weight, moisture content, dry density, and compaction ratio. A report is generated with the analysis results.

3. Subbase Analysis: Input parameters for subbase analysis include sand container weight, sand remaining weight, sand cone weight, and sand density. The application calculates sand weight, hole volume, total density, and compaction ratio. A report is generated with the analysis results.

4. Save Reports: Users can save the analysis reports in text format for future reference.

5. Clear Data: Clear buttons are provided to reset input fields and reports for both soil and subbase analysis.

Installation:

To run the application, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system along with PyQt5. You can install PyQt5 using pip:

```
pip install PyQt5
```

Usage:

1. Run the Application: Execute the `SoilStrengthAnalyzer.py` script to launch the application.

2. Input Data: Input the required data in the provided fields under the "إدخال البيانات" (Input Data) section for soil or subbase analysis.

3. Calculate: Click on the "احسب" (Calculate) button to perform the analysis.

4. View Report: The analysis results will be displayed in the text area below the input fields.

5. Save Report: Click on the "حفظ التقرير" (Save Report) button to save the analysis report in a text file.

6. Clear Data: Use the "تنظيف" (Clear) button to clear input fields and reports.

7. Switch Tabs: Switch between the "فحوصات التربة" (Soil Tests) and "فحوصات السبيس" (Subbase Tests) tabs to perform respective analyses.
